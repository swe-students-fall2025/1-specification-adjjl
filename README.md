## Stakeholders

Athan Zhang <br/>
Problems:
- what if recipes are not beginner friendly?
- what if i donâ€™t have enough ingredients or equipment to really make anything?
  - could suggest recipes with the things you have + more things to buy?
- what if i forget to list something basic, like salt or pepper?
- what if i use different names for ingredients or vague names, i.e. peppers vs habaneros, flour vs bread flour, eggs vs duck eggs
- what if i have allergies / food restrictions?

Goals:
- help me think of flavorful recipes that i can make on demand
- let me be able to save recipes i want to make in the future or that i made and liked
- let me be able to accommodate for substitutions
- let me be able to sort by cooking time / cooking difficulty
